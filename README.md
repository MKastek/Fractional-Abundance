# Fractional Abundance

As an example, we will determine the FA for Li, with the following assumptions for the plasma:
- The plasma is rare, so collisional recombination involving two electrons is
unlikely (negligible),
- The plasma is optically thin, i.e., the plasma does not absorb radiation, so ionization
due to absorption of energy hÎ½ is negligible,
- We assume a stationary state i.e. that changes occur slowly.
All kinetic equations describing the incomplete thermodynamic equilibrium of ionization and
recombination are as follows:
